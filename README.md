# CS-230-Operating-Platforms

## Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design? 
The Gaming Room is a client of Creative Technology Solutions who is looking to expand their gaming app called Draw It or Lose It to multiple platforms by making the game a web-based game. The client wants us to evaluate the platforms that this game will be playable on such as desktop and mobile.

## What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
In this documentation I was able to identify the pros and cons of the possible server side platforms particularly well.

## What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
There are many options and possibilities when deciding what operating system to choose for the server side of the game, but by working through the design document I was able to narrow it down to a few choices.

## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I could choose one part of these document to revise, I would choose the development requirements. I would add more detail to help me understand what the possibilities and limitations are for different platforms.

## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I made sure to read and understand what the client was asking for, and in return this helped me implement user needs into the software design. It is important to consider user's needs since the success of the project depends on them being able to both play and enjoy the game.

## How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I approached designing software by searching for additional information to help me bridge my knowledge gaps. I would make sure to catalog information in a document or paper in order to have it readily available when filling out the design document.
